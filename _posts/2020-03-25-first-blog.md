This is my first attempt at anything front end. Since I just want something that works I totally just ripped off the great work of [clarcklab](https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown).
See the link for how to operate this website. However, its great work that is simple to understand. So im just going to start putting in recipes.

Happy cooking!
