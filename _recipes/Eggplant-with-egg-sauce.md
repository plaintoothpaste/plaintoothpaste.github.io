title: "Eggplant with egg sauce"
image: Eggplant-with-egg-sauce.jpg
tags: pasta, vegatarian

ingredients:
- Eggplant ( 1 large 2 or 3 Lebanese)
- Potato starch or rice starch
- Flour
- Onion (half 1 large)
- Lemon juice (one lemon)
- Can of whole tomatoes
- 2 or 3 eggs
- Pasta ( 2 serves)

directions:
- Dice or slice the eggplant then lightly salt in a bowl.
- Coarsely chop the onion and set aside.
- Remove eggs from fridge.
- If eggplant is not too bitter you don't need to towel and drain. Not draining will make the eggplant not as pretty.
- Coat the eggplant in a 50 / 50 mixture of starch and flour. Speedy method> place eggplant and flour mixture in a bowl or bag and then shake together.
- Remove excess flour mixture.
- Heat frying pan medium high with olive oil.
- Pan fry eggplant.
- Flip once or twice once crispy.
- Remove from the pan the eggplant and set aside.
- Start boiling salted water for pasta.
- Mean-while add the onions to the fry pan with some oil.
- Once the onions start to brown, add the can of tomatoes and smash up.
- Allow to simmer. Optional a small amount of chili (fresh or sauce to taste).
- Once the water is boiling add the pasta and cook until a little too firm to enjoy (maybe 5 minutes for dry pasta).
- Drain the pasta but keep about 1/2 cups of pasta water.
- Add eggplant, pasta and water to the fry pan.
- Add lemon juice, if required add salt to taste.
- Turn off the stove about 1 minute after adding pasta.
- Crack eggs into the fry pan and mix all together.

Recommend a large or high sided fry pan.
Best enjoyed immediately after cooking.

This is a gradual combination of several recipes over time and I would say is now an original.
